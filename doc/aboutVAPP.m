%VAPP is the Berkeley Verilog-A Parser and Processor. VAPP is distributed
%as part of MAPP, the Berkeley Model and Algorithm Prototyping Platform.
%
%VAPP is a tool to import Verilog-A models into MAPP. Verilog-A files are
%translated into the ModSpec format which is the native model specification
%format of MAPP. ModSpec is a general model specification format, i.e., not
%just for electrical devices, and supports a wider variety of tools for
%defining device models than Verilog-A does. Since MAPP's emphasis is on
%electrical devices and circuits, ModSpec offers convenient ways of dealing
%with voltages and currents. However, this feature is designed with good
%modeling practices in mind. In order to encourage model developers to
%observe these principles, MAPP's interface for electrical quantities only
%supports a subset of the Verilog-A language.
